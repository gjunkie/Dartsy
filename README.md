Dartsy
=========

A few years ago I made my first iOS app using Appcelerator Titanium. It is a dart scroing app. I got as far as
supporting the 3.5" iPhone and original iPad. I might take another stab at this using Swift at a later date, but since
the app is no longer available on the iOS App Store, I figure I'd make this public for anyone who wanted to see it.

##Disclaimer: I was a young buck when I wrote this.
